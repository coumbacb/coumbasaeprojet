Outside the university I have many passions. In sports, I like basketball. It's a sport I played in my youth. What I'm intersted in is team play, for example.  I find that group work makes it possible to raprocher each other.

<p>In addition, I had the opportunity in life to travel a lot. It helped me to have an open mind by discovering other environments. These trips also helped me develop my language skills. In English, Portuguese and Arabic.</p>
